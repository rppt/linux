TODO
=====

1. Add tests trying to memblock_add() or memblock_reserve() 129th region.
   This will trigger memblock_double_array(), make sure it succeeds.
   *Important:* These tests require valid memory ranges, use dummy physical
                memory block from common.c to implement them. It is also very
                likely that the current MEM_SIZE won't be enough for these
                test cases. Use realloc to adjust the size accordingly.

2. Add tests for memblock_alloc_node() to check if the correct NUMA node is set
   for the new region
